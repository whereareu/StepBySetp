Extension Function

Kotlin gives the programmer the ability to add more funnctionality to the existing classes, by without inheriting them. This is achieved through a feature konwn as extensions. When a function is added to an existing class it is konw as Extension Function

// A sample class to demonstrate extension functions 
class Circle (val radius: Double){ 
    // member function of class 
    fun area(): Double{ 
        return Math.PI * radius * radius; 
    } 
} 

fun main(){ 
    // Extension function created for a class Circle 
    fun Circle.perimeter(): Double{ 
        return 2*Math.PI*radius; 
    } 
    // create object for class Circle 
    val newCircle = Circle(2.5); 
    // invoke member function 
    println("Area of the circle is ${newCircle.area()}") 
    //invoke extension function 
    println("Perimeter of the circle is ${newCircle.perimeter()}") 
} 

Area of the circle is 19.634954084936208
Perimeter of the circle is 15.707963267948966
